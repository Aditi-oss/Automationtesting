public class localvariable234 {
    public static void main(String[]args)
    {
        int b=20;//local varaible
    }
    int sachin=10;
    {
        System.out.println(sachin);//yes avaiable here
    }
    //System.out.println(sachin);//not
}
//local variable is not access within the curly bases not aviable.
//so inside the method of inside not outside

We can see an interview questioned most of asked 

within the outside of the method we cannot access the lets took an example like sachin.
